# An eclectic Emacs config 

This config's structure is almost fully based on [oremacs](https://github.com/abo-abo/oremacs). Parts related to `evil-mode` are influenced by [redguardtoo/ .emacs.d](https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d), some keybindings ideas borrowed from [kaushalmodi/.emacs.d](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d).
